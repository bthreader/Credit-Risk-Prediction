Feature selection and cross-validation of different machine learning models to predict the probability of customer default using the ["Statlog"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29) data set. Consequent selection of decision thresholds for customer classification given a hypothetical set of goals for the bank providing the credit.
